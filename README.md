# This application generate different types of shapes:
-cogwheel polygonal contours  
-irregular polygons  
-regular polygons  
-circles,ellipsis  
-stars  
-rectangles  
-triangles

## In the next picture can be seen few of the shapes that can be generated:

## Generation of a star:  
<i> A user can generate a star with a number of vertices between 3 and 16</i>
<i> The second property that can be chosen by the user is <b> Depth <b/> and it is a value between 10% and 90% of Radius.<i/>
<i> The radius represent the distance from star center to the one of the vertices.The center point is randomly generated ,where x and y coordinates are values between -300 and 300<i/>
  
  * First image shows a _5_ vertices star with a depth of 60% *

  * Second image shows a _16_ vertices start with a depth of 90% *

  *For simplicity reason the explanation will continue with the first example. The algorith of star generation is the next one: *
